# GitHub Heatmap Streaker AGREEMENT

By using this repository and the bundled automation you acknowledge:

1. The scripts only automate commits for styling the GitHub contribution graph. They never provide intrusion, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access capabilities.
2. You use the tooling at your own risk. Proxy usage, delegation, or unattended execution remains the user's responsibility.
3. SSH keys, personal passwords, and other credentials are never requested or persisted by this project. Only the GitHub-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN` inside Actions is used for pushes.
4. Automated commit activity may trigger GitHub anti-abuse checks. You must comply with GitHub's Terms of Service and enforce your own safeguards.
5. The project is delivered “as is” without guarantees about availability, correctness, or any form of warranty. All liabilities remain with the user.
